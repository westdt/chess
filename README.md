# Chess
A very simple chess game with a chess bot to play against.
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is threefold: learning, demonstrating my skills, and just having fun.
#### Learning
- Learn Rust better: Rust is a language that I have been interested ever since I learned about it. Previously I had learned Java before moving onto C/C++ since I was interested in video game development. I really fell in love with C because it was so stripped down compared to the bloat of Java, however C has many many problems that have since been solved by other languages. I view Rust as the successor to C in many ways and I think that Rust has a very bright future ahead of it.

- Learn TypeScript and how to use it side-by-side with Rust: Learning JavaScript is something that almost every developer tries at some point. Most frontends use JavaScript and learning how to use it enables me to work on and understand thousands of frontends. Learning how to integrate this with Rust was a challenge that I approached in a very non-typical way.
 
- âœ¨Tauri! âœ¨   Tauri is an amazing toolkit for implementing a frontend with a Rust backend as well as having many more features that I have yet to apply. In my opinion, Tauri is a real gamechanger and I see Rust + Tauri + React as being an extremely powerful and promising option for the future.
#### Demonstrating my skills
- General development: This project shows my knowledge of basic coding concepts like variables, types, structs, logic gates/control flow, and many more.

- Rust : This project demonstrates my ability to code idiomatic Rust using key Rust features such as borrowing, match statements, and immutability, as well as just a general understanding of Rust's syntax.

- Frontend: This project demonstrates my ability to write a simple frontend and have it send requests to the backend and then respond to those requests.

#### Having fun!
- I do enjoy coding and learning all of these languages and how to implement them to create a functional chess game has been fun for me.

- I have always wanted to write a chess bot. Now that I have written a frontend I can write one!

## Current Features
- Chess move generation and validation
    - Normal moves
    - En passant
    - Castling
    - Check validation
    - Checkmate detection
- Fully playable chess bot
    - Uses minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Simple plain TS/HTML/CSS frontend
- Rust backend

## Planned Features
- Move to React: Plain TS/HTML/CSS was easier to whip something up quickly but I plan on moving it to React.
- Algebraic notation: Need to add a feature to detect moves and determine the appropriate notation.
- Better chess bot: The current chess bot is very poor ðŸ˜… I plan to make it better and add book openings
- Better bot support: I would like to be able to have different bots that can be easily selected and used.
- Restructure/optimization: There are a lot of optimization and structure decisions I made for ease of coding, but these need to be fixed eventually.
